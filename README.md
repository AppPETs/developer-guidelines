### Style / Workflow

1. Place each sentence on a single line. This makes reviewing and commenting changes easier. Paragraphs are added with two line breaks anyway.
2. If you want feedback on your change, please submit a [Change Request](https://help.gitbook.com/books/what-are-change-requests.html).
3. Add feedback via inline discussions, i.e. by clicking on the `+` symbol right to the paragraph in reading mode.
