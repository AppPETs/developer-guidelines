# About

**TODO:** add logo

This document outlines basic aspects of mobile apps which should be considered for writing mobile apps in order to build privacy protection into the apps.

We are convinced that **privacy protection is an attractive feature** and can attract addtional users. We aim on providing **easy to implement** privacy features **without limiting** the functions of your app.

Basic concepts of privacy problems and how to address them using privacy enhancing technologies \(PETs\) are combined with legal hints how you comply with data protection law, i.e. the new european data protection regulation.

The guideline is work in progress and written as part of the [AppPETs](http://app-pets.org/home/) project \(funded by the German [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html)\). Contributions, feedback and discussion is welcomed.

### Style / Workflow

1. Place each sentence on a single line. This makes reviewing and commenting changes easier. Paragraphs are added with two line breaks anyway.
2. If you want feedback on your change, please submit a [Change Request](https://help.gitbook.com/books/what-are-change-requests.html).
3. Add feedback via inline discussions, i.e., by clicking on the `+` symbol right to the paragraph in reading mode.
