## Anti-Feature
Anti-Features are functions that do not provide the user with any benefits, but instead actually have an opposite effect.
Tracking functions, advertisements, dependency on third-party modules, which may not be free, or the loss of functions are all generally referred to as anti-features.

## Barrier-free
Barrier-free as a term in this document refers to the provision of information in such a way, that it can be understood by people with disabilities and older people, in the same way as a person without any such limitations.

## Blacklist
Blacklists represent the opposite of Whitelists and are used when the security standards previously applied are not fulfilled.
Blacklists are used by companies as filters for installable applications on devices that are managed via Mobile Device Management software.

## Certificate Pinning
Certificate Pinning describes the process of comparing server certificates with a custom certificate table, in order to avoid manipulation of the root certificate.

## Commissioned Data Processing
Commissioned Data Processing serves the purpose of ensuring outsourced data processing from a data protection perspective.
Responsibility for correct data processing remains with the order issuer, however.

## Custom ROM
Custom ROM (user-defined read-only-memory, opposite of manufacturer ROM) is an alternative operating system image, which is aligned with the requirements of the user.
It can be installed on smartphones and allows a deeper level of configuration than is possible with manufacturer ROMs.

## Data Economy
Data economy is, according to §3a of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the principle of collecting and gathering only as much personal data as absolutely necessary to enable full functionality of a service (e.g. an application).
Collected data has to be anonymized or pseudonymized as much as possible.

## Data Worthy of Protection
Data worthy of protection is mostly identical to personally identifiable data.
There are differences however, e.g. business relevant data (trade secrets, confidential information), personal notes and other sensitive information with no direct connection to a physical person.

## Encryption
Encryption in accordance with the latest technologies refers to a continually evolving designation of the security level of encryption procedures.
Current summary (as at 31.10.2013): RC4 – not sufficient; AES – not optimal, but trustworthy with AES 256Bit; Twofish or Salsa20 are good alternatives; CBC & Hamac – not sufficient; RSA – only with a key length of at least 2048Bit; 4096DSA keys with at least 2048Bit are more secure, if in doubt use RSA; Elliptic curves – co-developed by the NSA (may thus have weaknesses); Hash procedures: SHA2/256 recommended, MD5 and SHA1 not recommended.

## Failure by Design
"Failure by Design" is a term that describes the opposite of "Privacy by Design".
It describes fundamental errors made when designing an infrastructure, which prevent data-protection-compliant behavior.

## Hash Function
Hash functions are generally used to verify the content of transmitted data.
Hash values are also often used to transmit a recognizable value, which is based on a "checksum" of a date, but not the date itself.
This should ensure recognizability without actually providing the date itself.

## Mobile Device Management (MDM)
Mobile Device Management software secures, monitors and manages mobile devices deployed in enterprises.
It allows centralized control and administration over connected mobile devices and can ensure users are following the company's security policies.

## Mozilla Server Side TLS Guidelines
The goal of this site is to help operational teams with the configuration of TLS on servers and to offer an single point of information that is going to be updated as new technical standards eveolve.

## Opt-In
Opt-In means it is necessary to include the user in making a decision.
The user MUST actively provide their consent.
Its opposite is Opt-Out describes a generally activated function that has to be deactivated manually by the user.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personally identifiable data are, according to §3 para. 1 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), "Individual pieces of information relating to personal or professional circumstances of a specific or specifiable person", in other words, data, the content of which can be used to determine the person to which it relates.
According to §3 para. 9 BDSG, there is also "special types of personal data".
This includes health-related data, information on race or ethnic origin, political, religious, trade union or sexual orientation.

## Privacy by Design (PbD)
"Privacy by Design" is a term that refers to "taking data protection into consideration" during product development.
This generally relates to the fact that data-protection-relevant topics can be implemented unproblematically, if they are dealt with from the very beginning.
It has been proven that the subsequent implementation of data protection is more expensive and also more complex.
Usability and quality generally also suffer as a result of this.

## Pseudonymization
Pseudonymization describes a data protection procedure, which, for example, replaces the name with a pseudonym (a combination of letters or numbers), in order to make it significantly more difficult to identify the person in question.
In contrast to anonymization, all data, which has been pseudonymized using the same pseudonymization procedure, remains connected.

## Root / Jailbreak
Root / Jailbreak describes the process of extending a user's rights on the end device.
After a jailbreak the administrator rights are held by the user and no longer by the manufacturer, as is the case with standard Desktop Computers, which means the user will be able to remove usage restrictions, fix security gaps or remove undesired, preinstalled applications.
With access to system partitions and operating system relevant files it is also possible to cause damage to the operating system.

## State of the Art Technology
State of the art technology as a term in this document refers to the highest achievable level technology has to offer in the time period of application production.
Since technology evolves rapidly, the developer has to take into account the latest technological changes available to the public.

## Salt
Salt refers to a randomly selected character string in cryptography, which is attached to some clear text prior to usage, which is then to be used as a hash to increase the randomness of the entry.
It is mainly used to defend user data against special attacks such as dictionary attacks.

## Whitelist
Whitelists refer to lists of applications, which satisfy previously defined security characteristics.
Whitelists are used by companies as filters for installable applications on devices managed via Mobile Device Management software.
