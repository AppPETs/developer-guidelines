# Planning Phase

## Defining the Purpose and Functionality of the App

### The App's Purpose

What will the app do for the end-user? It might seem obvious, but **it is a good start to take a moment and reconsider what the actual aim of the app is**.

- Which functions should the app provide and 
- which user data is necessary for the planned functionality.  

Especially it is important to carefully think which user data is needed and how it will be processed.

**Determining the purpose is important for deciding upon the functionality that may be included in the app, and if and how user data needs to be processed.**

*For example a weather app might let you choose and display weather information; a firewall app might let you inhibit or monitor a smartphone's connections to the internet.
For this functions certain user data might be necessary or useful like geo-data or access to data connections. This data has implications which need to be taken into account at an early stage of development for proper integration of security measures.*

### Intended and Unintended Ways to Use the App

- [ ] is the unintended use a main issue here?


When planning the application design, consider not which purpose you design the app for but also take into account that users might find alternative ways to use the app which can have an impact on other users of the device.

~~in what context the app shall be used. 
For instance, an emergency alert app might be intended for covering certain geographical areas, particular periods of time or predefined cases.~~ 
~~An app might be used, though, for other purposes not intended in the first place. ~~


*For examle a firewall app can give you information about other apps' illegitimate connections to the internet. Yet it might also give end users a tool to secretly record and monitor other users' internet activities.*

**Be creative about potentially harmful ways to use of your app. Think about safeguards against illegitimate uses.**

*For example in the case of a firewall app a notification about the monitoring activity in the background would give the user transparency.*

## Defining the App's Functionality and Permissions

A privacy-friendly app will only include functionality and permissions that is needed to serve the purpose determined in the beginning. 

**Think about which permissions are essential for providing the functionality.**

*An app providing location based services does not need to access the device's microphone to do so.*

Any functionality that is not strictly necessary to serve the intended purpose requires additional and explicit consent by the end-user. (Kommentar: Sollte die nicht ganz raus, bzw. sollten Zusatzfunktionen mit notwendigen Zugriffsrechten optional sein, und Funktionen / Zugriffsrechte, die nicht selbsterlärend sind erklärt werden?)


## Defining the sort of data to be used

### Primary Data

Specify all categories of data needed to be fed to the app or to be used to make it work. This may be data related to the end-user or to other data subjects concerned. Apart from personal data, consider content data needed.

### Secondary Data

When using the app, even more data will be produced. This might be user content (e.g. messages), log data, data related to payment, statistics to authorizing access or other. These will also contain personal data that require protection and thus need to be specified and assessed.
