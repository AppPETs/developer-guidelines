# Planning Phase

## Defining the Purpose of the App

### The App's Purpose

What will the app do for the end-user? An accurate descripition of the aim it is meant to achieve is fundamental for creating a privacy-friendly application. - A weather app might let you choose and display weather information. A firewall app might be meant to inhibit or monitor a smartphone's connections to the internet.

-&gt; Determining the purpose is important for deciding upon the functionality that may be included in the App.

### The App's Intended and Potential Use

When planning an app's design, consider in what field the app shall be used. For instance, an emergency app might be intended for covering certain geographical areas, particular periods of time or predefined cases.

An app might be used, though, for other purposes not intended in the first place. A firewall app can give you information about other apps' illegitimate connections to the internet. Yet it might also give end users a tool secretly to record and monitor other people's activities on the internet.

-&gt; Might the app be used in a way harmful to people and their privacy? Consider safeguards against illegitimate uses, e.g. by ensuring transparency when the app is running.

## Defining the App's functionality

A privacy-friendly app will only include functionality that is needed to serve the purpose determined in the beginning. An app providing location based services does not need to access the device's microphone to do so.

Any functionality that is not strictly necessary to serve the intended purpose requires additional and explicit consent by the end-user.

## Defining the sort of data to be used

### Primary Data

Specify all categories of data needed to be fed to the app or to be used to make it work. This may be data related to the end-user or to other data subjects concerned. Apart from personal data, consider content data needed.

### Secondary Data

When using the app, even more data will be produced. This might be log data, data related to payment, statistics to authorizing access or other. These will also contain personal data that require protection and thus need to be specified and assessed.

### Increased Level of Protection

Special categories of data are placed under particular protection of the law.

#### Sensitive data

Amongst these are personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. These data generally may only be used where the data subject has given explicit consent regarding these very categories of information.

#### Individuals in need of special protection

In addition, where children or other persons who require particular legal protection are involved, the processing of data might be more restricted than otherwise.

#### Extend of data used

Where the information on individuals used by the app is particularly comprehensive, exposing their conduct or characteristics, particular attention needs to be paid to the protection of those data.
