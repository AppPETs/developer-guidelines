# Key Takeaways

- Security and privacy have to be taken into consideration before the implementation of the app actually starts.
- Security is a fast developing branch. Pay attention to technological progress.
- Mobile application security is only one aspect of a broader security strategy and should be considered as such during application production.
- Ensure that latest encryption standards are fulfilled.
- Ensure that third-party integration points are safe and tested.
- Ensure server identity and data integrity verification.
- Domains within enterprise control normally have a lower risk profile assuming a robust security policy. The more control you have, all else being equal, the more secure the application.
- Collect user data only when it is absolutely necessary.
- Store only what is necessary on the device.
- Never send sensitive information such as credentials over a network connection in clear text form.
