## Foundations

### Terminology

**TODO**:

* [ ] Transparency: legal vs. IT
* [ ] Unlinkability vs. Purpose-binding: legal vs. academic definition
* [ ] Anonymity vs. Pseudonymity \(often erroneously in privacy policies and public statements\)

### Privacy by Design and Default

* All data protection-relevant aspects related to the end user must be planned to be secure
* All options for ensuring data protective behavior have to be preconfigured in a way a user can not accidentally lose personal information
* Data access takes place in line with data economy principles
* Data not immediately used may not be collected
* Passing data to third parties requires an **Opt-In** from the user
  * Opt-In means that the user needs to explicitly confirm the data transfer beyond the scope of the application

### Threats to Privacy

**TODO**: Entries marked with \(CC\) were taken from the Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals \([PDF](https://www.niap-ccevs.org/MMO/PP/pp_md_v3.0.pdf)\).

* [ ] Eavesdropping \(CC\)
* [ ] Network Attack \(CC\)
* [ ] Physical Access \(CC\)
* [ ] Malicious / Flawed Application \(CC\)
* [ ] Persistent Presence \(CC\)
* [ ] Insider Attacks
  * [ ] Rogue Employee
  * [ ] Accidental Misconfiguration

### Risk Assessment

* ideally after each Development Phase you need to reassess the risks.

### Data Protection Goals

#### Classic Perspective

**Confidentiality**

**Integrity**

**Availability**

#### Legal Perspective

**TODO**: Explain the differences between the classical and the legal perspectives on CIA again? They are explained in the SDM.

**Data Minimization**

**Availability**

**Integrity**

**Confidentiality**

**Unlinkability**

**Transparency**
