##Phases in the Developer Guidelines:

* [PlanningPhase.md](./PlanningPhase.md)

* [AnalysisPhase.md](./AnalysisPhase.md)

* [DesignPhase.md](./DesignPhase.md)

* [ImplementationPhase.md](./ImplementationPhase.md)

* [TestingPhase.md](./TestingPhase.md)

* [MaintenancePhase.md](./MaintenancePhase.md)
